Carvilla is a luxery car managment website by Ledion Lamce.

Parts of it are still work in progress, such as the search feature, but every feature requested in the lab assignment is there
A template was used for the index, but everything else was put together by me.
The pages contain the appropriate session checks.
The log in and sign up pages are done as we were instructed.
You can sign up, log in, and when you are logged in, you can add new cars, or manage existing ones by being able to edit them or delete them.
All buttons in the table pages are functional.
I hope you enjoyed reviewing this project!

(A database made by me is also found in the project folder. The password for the user account given is "12345678a" and the email is "UserExample@gmail.com")
